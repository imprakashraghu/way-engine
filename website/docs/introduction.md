# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for **Your Graph Engine** — a modular, extensible graph and interaction engine designed for building complex editors, workflow tools, diagramming systems, and visual interfaces.

This library is structured around small, focused systems:

- **Graph Model** – Nodes, ports, edges, validation.
- **Event System** – Everything emits events (node added, edge removed, etc.).
- **Selection System** – Single and multi-selection.
- **History System** – Undo/redo built on a command architecture.
- **Command System** – Structured commands for modifying the graph.
- **Interaction System** – Dragging, marquee selection.
- **Hit Testing System** – Determine what’s under the cursor.
- **Keyboard System** – Hotkeys, delete, undo/redo.
- **Serialization System** – Export/import graph state (JSON).

Use the sidebar to navigate into each system.
