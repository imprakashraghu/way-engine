# Interaction Overview

The Interaction System defines how users interact with the graph on the canvas.

It includes:

- Dragging nodes
- Marquee (box) selection
- Hit testing (detecting objects under cursor)
- Keyboard interactions (delete, undo/redo)

Each interaction is implemented as its own manager.
