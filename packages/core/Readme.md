- This package defines nodes with: id, position, type, data, ports.
- This package defines edges with: id, sourceNodeId, sourcePortId, targetNodeId, targetPortId, data.
- This package defines ports with: id, type, position, data.
- The graph model contains nodes, edges, and optional metadata.
- The event model defines notifications such as node:added, node:moved, edge:connected, and graph:changed.
- The selection model tracks selected nodes and edges and supports actions such as selectNode, selectNodes, and clearSelection.
- The command model defines actions such as addNode, moveNode, addEdge, and clearSelection, forming the basis of history and undo/redo.
- The history model tracks command snapshots and provides undo, redo, and clearHistory functionality.
- The serialization model defines how graphs, nodes, edges, and ports are saved to and loaded from JSON.
- The metadata model defines optional graph, node, and edge metadata such as version, timestamps, and custom fields.
- The viewport model tracks the pan (x, y) and zoom level of the diagram.
- The validation model ensures graph integrity by checking nodes, edges, ports, and references.
- The state model centralizes graph, selection, viewport, history, validation, and event subsystems into one unified engine state.
- The engine model exposes the public API, including graph operations, selection, commands, history, events, and serialization.
- The integration model defines how subsystems (graph, selection, viewport, history, validation, events) interact inside the state and engine.
- The lifecycle model defines engine phases such as init, load, update, reset, and destroy, along with related engine events.
